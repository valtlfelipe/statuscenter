## Motivation
Currently as a single person that manages the status page on my company, I had, sometimes, the necessity to update the page on the go, without getting on my computer, or to follow long steps to just post an update (open the mobile browser, search for the site, log in, etc). So I thinked, why not create an app to help me with that (and maybe others that have the same "issue") and take this opportunity to learn something new.

Currently the app is priced (cheap) to help me to pay the apple developer license so I can publish for iOS too.

## Features
- List all incidents (open, resolved and maintenances)
- Create new updates on open incidents
- Create new incident
- Schedule new maintenance
- Automatic dark mode
- No tracking / ads ...

More to come...
